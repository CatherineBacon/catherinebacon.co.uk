I've spent the last week working through the node.js section of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)....

Boy, am I confused.

I don't have a computer background and didn't tinker with the things as a kid, so I didn't really have a clue what a server was until last weekend!

Now I have a slightly better idea. Slightly.

I'd never really thougth about how a website works or what's happening when you type a url...you just kinda saw a web page...that was it. Never really considered it any further.

I can now see how you request something and the server send you back an html file or some such thing. (Still vague, and very hand-wavy.) I'm going to have to find a dummies guide to node/servers somewhere and get reading.
