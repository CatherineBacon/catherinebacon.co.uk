      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;ve been steadily working through the FreeCodeCamp (fcc) online bootcamp. This app started life as part of one of fcc&amp;rsquo;s backend projects. However, my parents were intrigued by the site. They are members of a book club and so have a steady supply of books which they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have chosen to read and don&amp;rsquo;t really want to keep. This is how my parents became my first &amp;ldquo;clients&amp;rdquo; and generated a list of requirements for them to use the site.</description>
